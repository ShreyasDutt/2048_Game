Super Mario Bros. Font

--ABOUT--
After learning how to make fonts with CorelDraw, and totally failing
to find the Super Mario Font on the internet, I decided to make my own!
Feel free to redistribute it, but it would be nice if you'd redistribute
it along with this readme file, preferably in the original .zip file
that I posted on my site (www.geocities.com/cursemonkey/font.html)

--CURRENT VERSION--
(2000-8-4)
The current version includes all of the symbols that you can type from
the keyboard.  It does not include lower-case letters, and never will -
this is an all caps font.  I may eventually try to add some of the symbols
that you can't type from the keyboard (e.g. copyright symbol), and I may
also try to fine-tune some of the finished letters and numbers, but for
all intents and purposes, this is a virtually complete release.

--INSTALLATION--
If you don't know how to install a new font, here's the deal (for
windows only):
1. Go to Start->Settings->Control Panel (the control panel is the key
here, there are probably multiple ways to get to it.)
2. Double-click on the "Fonts" icon.
3. In the window that pops up, click File->Install new font, and find
the .ttf file that came with this readme file.  Click and add it, and
you've got my amazing SMB font on your own computer.

--DISCLAIMER--
I am in no way affiliated with Nintendo Co. Ltd. or any of their partners.
This font is an unofficial variation on the one used by them for the
Mario games, and I don't claim any ownership to that original font.
It's just for fun, people!
